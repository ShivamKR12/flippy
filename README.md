## How to Play

1. Choose your tile color (White or Black)
2. Click on the board to place your tile
3. Valid moves are highlighted when hints are enabled
4. The goal is to have more tiles of your color than the opponent
5. Game ends when neither player can make a valid move

## Game Rules

Reversi is played on an 8x8 board. Players take turns placing tiles that flip opponent tiles between their own. A move is valid if it flips at least one opponent tile. The game follows standard Othello rules with proper pass mechanics.
